/// <c>GET /health</c> for every service, and the reason it is a CONTROLLER rather than
/// <c>app.MapHealthChecks("/health")</c>: MapHealthChecks registers an endpoint with no ApiExplorer metadata,
/// so Swashbuckle never puts <c>/health</c> in the service's OpenAPI document. Both halves of the gateway's
/// aggregated Swagger UI are built from that document -- the "ALL endpoints" view IS the document, and MMLib's
/// "- v1" view is the same document rewritten through the route table -- so neither can show a path the
/// document does not contain. Health checks answered 200 all along and were invisible in both.
///
/// <para>Shared rather than copied into six services because there is one health contract, not six. It reaches
/// each service through <c>AddApplicationPart</c> beside that service's <c>AddControllers()</c>; a service that
/// forgets the call has no /health at all, which is what HealthEndpointTests fails the build over.</para>
///
/// <para>Anonymous, and published anonymously at the edge. A probe, a load balancer and an uptime monitor have
/// no token to present. The cost is that anyone who reaches the edge can tell which services are up, so this
/// returns the aggregate status and NOTHING else -- no check names, no exception text, no versions, no
/// durations. The detailed view stays on the container's own port and on the Development-only
/// <c>/dev/{service}/health</c> passthrough.</para>
