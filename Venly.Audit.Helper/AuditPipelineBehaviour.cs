/// <summary>
/// Turns an <see cref="IAuditable"/> marker into a published audit event.
///
/// <para>It runs AFTER the handler and only on success, which is the whole design: an audit row is a claim
/// that something happened, so publishing before the handler — or regardless of its result — would fill the
/// table with actions that were rejected, rolled back, or never attempted.</para>
///
/// <para>Registered with <c>config.AddOpenBehavior(typeof(AuditPipelineBehaviour&lt;,&gt;))</c> AFTER
/// <c>ValidatePipelineBehaviour</c>, so a request that fails validation short-circuits before reaching this at
/// all. The 400-and-above check below is the second line of defence, for a handler that returns a failure
/// code of its own.</para>
///
/// <para>The constraints mirror <see cref="Venly.Backend.Common.Pipelines.ValidatePipelineBehaviour{TRequest,
/// TResponse}"/>. MediatR only applies an open behaviour to requests that satisfy them, so a request outside
/// the RequestResponse convention simply does not get this behaviour rather than failing to register.</para>
